## What is MNREGA ?
MNREGA stands for <b>Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act</b>. It's objective is to 
- Provide 100 days of guaranteed wage employment to rural unskilled labour
- Increase economic security
- Decrease migration of labour from rural to urban areas

It gives a significant amount of control to the Gram Panchayats for managing public works, strengthening Panchayati Raj Institutions. Gram Sabhas are free to accept or reject recommendations from Intermediate and District Panchayats.
<br> <br>
It incorporates accountability in its operational guidelines and ensures compliance and transparency at all levels.


## Current systemt and it's issues

### working:

Once work is allocated and workers are assigned work, The MGNREGA Spatial Enumerator (MSE) officer uploads images of progress about the project at three stages
- beginning of project
- half way through the project
- on project completion
and all these information is publicly available on governments site.

### shortcoming:

Even with all the check present in current system there are some major shortcomings such as:
- lack of check for uploaded images
- lack of ease of access
- lack of check for plagiarism

One such example of mis-happening is presented below:
